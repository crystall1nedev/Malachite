---
## What is it?
Malachite is a **work-in-progress** app that gives you more control over the macro lens of (or connected to) your iPhone.

## What do I need?[^1]
You'll need one of the following configurations...
- iPhone 13 Pro/Pro Max or later Pro models
- An iPhone with a macro lens accessory attached  
...and **iOS 14.0** or later.

## What can I do with this?
Currently, you can use the macro lens as a magnifier for small things (camera view and a flashlight are implemented.) Over the coming weeks, I'll be putting in pinch to zoom, proper photo capture support, and manual focus enhancements.

## How do I get it?
I'll release the first build of Malachite in the Releases tab when it's ready for prime time. Until then:
1. Clone this repo
2. Open `Malachite.xcodeproj`
3. Change the codesigning team in `Signing & Capabilities`
4. Build!

[^1]: This list is what I hope to target all the way through. If development hurdles come up, some functionality may be restricted to newer releases that are not listed here. Configurations that are not listed are not supported by this app. Devices older than the iPhone 11 are not supported ion any capacity.
