*noun*
1. a crystal with the properties of revealing hidden parts of yourself
2. the name of my app to take control of the macro lens on iPhone
---
## What is it?
Malachite is a **work-in-progress** app that makes using iPhone with macro lenses... great magnifiers.

## What do I need?[^1]
You'll need one of the following configurations...
- iPhone 13 Pro/Pro Max or later Pro models
- An iPhone with a macro lens accessory attached
...and **iOS 14.0** or later.

## What can I do with this?
It's pretty simple: open the app, and get close to what you want to magnify. It could be something as simple as finely woven cloth, or complex like a few caps on a motherboard. I've also included a flash button to help you illuminate your view.

## How do I get it?
I'll release the first build of Malachite in the Releases tab when it's ready for prime time. Until then:
1. Clone this repo
2. Open `Malachite.xcodeproj`
3. Change the codesigning team in `Signing & Capabilities`
4. Build!

[^1]: This list is what I hope to target all the way through. If development hurdles come up, some functionality may be restricted to newer releases that are not listed here. Configurations that are not listed are not supported by this app. Devices older than the iPhone 11 are not supported ion any capacity.
